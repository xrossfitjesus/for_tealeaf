#1 easier way to write an array

# p flintstones = %w("Fred", "Barney", "Wilma", "Betty", "BamBam", "Pebbles")

#2 adding element to an array

#flintstones = %w(Fred Barney Wilma Betty BamBam Pebbles)
# flintstones << "Dino"  or
#flintstones.push("Dino")
#p flintstones

#3 
advice = "Few things in life are as important as house training your pet dinosaur."

#advice.slice! "house"
#p advice
# answer in the book. advice.slice!(0, advice.index('house'))
#p advice
# the one given mutates the executed variable.

#4 count how many "t" in the string 
#statement = "The Flintstones Rock!"
#my aswer = p statement.count("t")
# Book answer = p statement.scan('t').count

#title = "Flintstone Family Members"

#p title.center(40)
